    "more": "Author: Andrea Stewart \n\nIn 2015, I began a project to collect biographical, professional, and connectivity information* for a subset of nearly 700 British-born or based women writers with the idea that a large-scale data analytic approach would reveal a more complete portrait of the Victorian era female author. In addition to having a lifespan touching at least one point in what most scholars consider to be “the long nineteenth century” (1789-1914),** this specific cohort of women writers was created using a second inclusion baseline criteria that each individual must have at least one verifiable, signed publication in order to validate their status as both a woman and a writer to match the scope of my research. From the collected biographical data, I used the data visualization software Gephi (version 0.9.2) in 2017 to generate a macro-network di-graph of the familial, social, and professional connections between my writerly cohort with a goal of using this graph as an entry point for studying long-nineteenth century female writers, examining how certain women functioned as highly visible and centrally located “nodes” within publishing networks and working to understand and reveal any new insights could be gained from viewing women’s relationships with each other on a comprehensive scale.\n\nForegrounding the metric of connectivity, rather than the number of texts a writer had produced or an arbitrary notion of canonicity, led to what I argue in previous writing on this subject is a more organic and serendipitous “discovery” of both nodal hotspots and isolations. \n\nNodes with numerous convergent edges appear larger than less-connected ones and are color-coded to reflect their higher or “hotter” degrees of connectivity – i.e., connected to more authors within the cohort. Red-colored nodes are women writers with the highest number of connections (more than 50) while writers with fewer associations are symbolized by a slightly “cooler” shade – orange – and have slightly less connections (more than 40). This color pattern repeats through lessening degrees of connectivity and nodal sizes, and moves across the rainbow color spectrum, finally ending with deep purple-colored points representing writers generally detached from the main groupings of other female authors (those with few or no connections).\n\nThis network visualization offers another unique way of engaging with a data set through a selection tool that allows users to select different “coloring” groups of authors with the same number range of connections – i.e., authors with 15-20 connections will appear in the selector, and from there the user can select individual authors to view their networks, and the networks of other authors they are connected to. This sorting capability makes visible not only highly authoritative nodes, but also less immediately discernable groupings of writers. At present, this selection tool only allows users to filter by connectivity, but I am working on ways to expand this capability to allow users to sort by the multitude of other data categories I have collected for each woman writer: birth date, death date, birth location, death location, class, education, religious affiliation, political affiliation, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, marriage, children, social groups/clubs/organizations, jobs, date of first publication, age at first publication, pseudonyms and other names, periodicals, and sources I drew these women’s names from and where to find more.\n\nThe graph presented here is a fourth-generation (fourth version) translation of the original Gephi-produced graph into a searchable online visualization using the Sigma.js tool and hosted on the open-code service GitHub. The addition of geographic location (birth) dates via node (author) label, and the overarching addition of all categorical information via metadata offers another layer of my ongoing research as a test to determine new ways to discover “things we did not know to look for”*** and, perhaps, eventually transform the way we think of, create, and build digital archives.\n\nProduced June 1, 2024. \n\nNotes\n*Connectivity decisions were made by me with a self-produced set of guidelines, checked with my academic advisor at the time during project discussions. For mutual connections, factors such as familial relations, friendships, reciprocal correspondence, social meetings, political or professional organization memberships, and professional connections such as editor/writer or reviewer/writer relationships were amongst the criteria for this kind of classification. For one-sided connections, factors such as editorial collections without contact with the writer; dedications; mentions, citations, or quotations; subscriptions; reviews without response; one-directional correspondence; and biographical writings on women of a previous generation were amongst the criteria for this kind of classification. This is not an exhaustive list, but an extensive one to show how these decisions were considered and made regarding connectivity.\n**Scholars do not always agree on the time period of the long nineteenth century: 1750-1914; 1789-1914; 1776-1918 are among the possibilities for duration classification. For this database, the long nineteenth century is defined as beginning in 1789 and ending in 1914. \n***Fyfe, “Technologies of Serendipity,” 263. \n\nSpreadsheet Numeric Shorthand Key\n\nLocation of Birth/Death\t\n1\tLondon\n2\tSouthern England\n3\tNorthern England\n4\tWales\n5\tScotland\n6\tIreland\n7\tAustralia\n8\tNew Zealand\n9\tIndia\n10\tCanada\n11\tOther\n\t\nJobs\t\n1\tWriter\n2\tEditor\n3\tOther\n4\tNo Job\n5\tEducator",
